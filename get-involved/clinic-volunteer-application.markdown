volunteer_description: "Undergraduate volunteers play key roles in running clinic
  every other Sunday, including intake, reception, lab, and interpreting. Volunteers
  will rotate through these roles throughout their time at clinic. Intake volunteers
  provide the initial patient assessment, performing vitals and a review of systems
  to present to the medical students (Co-D’s). Once this information has been collected,
  intake volunteers have the opportunity to interpret for the Co-D’s and Doctors,
  or shadow the patient’s visit, allowing for personalized patient interactions. Reception
  volunteers greet the patients, organize patient charts/paperwork, manage appointments
  and schedule follow-up visits. Lab volunteers are responsible for organizing lab
  samples, taking inventory, and keeping track of lab work sent to the UC Davis Medical
  Center in Sacramento. Interpreters accompany their patients throughout their clinic
  visit to act as a liaison between the physician/Co-D and the patient. Please note
  that while you do not need to speak Spanish to apply, having Spanish speaking volunteers
  is a vital necessity for any given clinic day in order to fulfill the KLHOC mission.
  \n<br /><br />\n<em>*As first and foremost a community-centered clinic, all volunteers
  will be expected to fulfill not only their responsibilities within clinic but also
  participate in a variety of community outreach, projects and events.</em>"
