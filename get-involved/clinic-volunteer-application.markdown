volunteer_description: "Undergraduate volunteers play key roles in running clinic
  every other Sunday, including intake, reception, lab, and interpreting. Volunteers
  will rotate through these roles throughout their time at clinic. \n \nIntake volunteers
  provide the initial patient assessment, performing vitals and a review of systems
  to present to the medical students (Co-D’s). Once this information has been collected,
  intake volunteers have the opportunity to interpret for the Co-D’s and Doctors,
  or shadow the patient’s visit, allowing for personalized patient interactions. \n
  \nReception volunteers greet the patients, organize patient charts/paperwork, manage
  appointments and schedule follow-up visits. \n \nLab volunteers are responsible
  for organizing lab samples, taking inventory, and keeping track of lab work sent
  to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. \n \nInterpreters accompany their
  patients throughout their clinic visit to act as a liaison between the physician/Co-D
  and the patient. Please note that while you do not need to speak Spanish to apply,
  having Spanish speaking volunteers is a vital necessity for any given clinic day
  in order to fulfill the KLHOC mission. \n\n{{*As first and foremost a community-centered
  clinic, all volunteers will be expected to fulfill not only their responsibilities
  within clinic but also participate in a variety of community outreach, projects
  and events.* | markdown}}"
