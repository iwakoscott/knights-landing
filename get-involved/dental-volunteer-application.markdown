  hygienists in filling cavities, extracting teeth, and cleaning teeth, Dental Committee
  members will gain experience with reception, patient intake, and scribing during
  patient interactions. \n\n\nUndergraduate volunteers for the Knights Landing One
  Health Clinic are part of a team of medical, health education, and veterinary volunteers
  who all aim to meet the healthcare needs of Knights Landing. Please note that although
