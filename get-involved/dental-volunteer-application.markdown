  Landing Dental Committeeâ€™s mission is to serve the community by improving access
  to dental care in Knights Landing. KLOHC Dental Committee members will have numerous
  opportunities to demonstrate leadership and will have the unique opportunity to
  be part of a community-centered clinic. In addition to assisting dentists and dental
  hygienists in filling cavities, extracting teeth, and cleaning teeth, Dental Committee
  members will gain experience with reception, patient intake, and scribing during
  patient interactions. \n\n\nUndergraduate volunteers for the Knights Landing One
  Health Clinic are part of a team of medical, health education, and veterinary volunteers
  who all aim to meet the healthcare needs of Knights Landing. Please note that although
  you do not need to speak Spanish to apply, having Spanish-speaking volunteers is
  a necessity for any given clinic day in order to fulfill the KLOHC mission. "
