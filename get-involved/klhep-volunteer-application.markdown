volunteer_description: "Education is a key component of the Knights Landing One Health
  Center. The Knights Landing Health Education Program (KLHEP) aims to provide health
  education for the Knights Landing community, specifically by working as one-on-one
  advocates for the patients of KLOHC. KLHEP volunteers will receive special training
  to educate patients on topics such as nutrition, chronic illness, health behavior,
  and health resources specific to Knights Landing. KLHEP operates as a part of regular
  KLOHC hours and dates. KLHEP volunteers will not be involved in the clinic volunteer
  positions described above but instead will work with patients during their visit
  to promote overall health and wellbeing outside of medical care.\n\n*As first and
  foremost a community-centered clinic, all volunteers will be expected to fulfill
  not only their responsibilities within clinic but also participate in a variety
  of community outreach, projects and events.*\n "
