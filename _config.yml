description: Knights Landing One Health Center aims to provide linguistically competent
  and culturally sensitive healthcare services to the rural underserved in the Knights
  Landing area. We seek to fill the gap in primary care services and health education,
  with particular emphasis on women, adolescents, and farmworkers. Our goal is to
  provide community-centered care by maintaining a high level of community engagement
  and empowerment, and by continuing to collaborate with other organizations. We are
  striving to develop a One Health model, linking.
